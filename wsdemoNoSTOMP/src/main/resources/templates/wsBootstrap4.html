 FROM https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_get_started.asp
  Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from jsDelivr when visiting another site.
  As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time.
  Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it,
  it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

  Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc).
  However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.

  The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that
  Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery.

Bootstrap 4 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
-->

<div class="container">
  <h1>Using Bootstrap container</h1>
  <p>Use the .container class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.
    <pre>
  Extra small <576px
  Small ≥576px
  Medium ≥768px
  Large ≥992px
  Extra large ≥1200px
  </pre>

    Resize the browser window to see that the container width will change at different breakpoints:</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Using Bootstrap container-fluid</h1>
  <p>Use the .container-fluid class to create full width container,
    that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):</p>

</div>

<div class="container-fluid pt-3">
  <h1>Using container-fluid with padding</h1>
    <p>
    By default, containers have 15px left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding.
    Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better.
    For example, .pt-3 means "add a top padding of 16px":
